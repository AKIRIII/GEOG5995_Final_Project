# GEOG5995_Final_Project

**Student ID: 201780058**

## 1 Background

In this project, I want to look into the economic condition in Leeds. The tasks are as follows.

> 1. to investigate if there is an interrelationship between economically active status and employment, health, house type, car ownership, education and religion;
> 2. to find the different economical groups(clusters) in Leeds by OA.

The main audience of this project is the government.

And the results aim to help them understand what may relate to people's economically active status and how the clustering feature in Leeds is, which may help them improve the life quality of the citizens and reduce the gap between poor and rich.

## 2 Data

There are 6 socio-demographic datasets and 1 boundary data.
